## Business Plan
1. Professional boxing banned in Sweden from 1970-2007.
2. There is a renewed interest in boxing in the Nordic countries, but concerns of safety remain
3. Proper training and education will mitigate these fears
4. Launch the Impactful SmartGlove in Sweden and prepare to expand into Denmark and Norway
5. Norway, Cuba and North Korea still ban professional boxing
6. Rumors on [BoxingScene.com](http://www.boxingscene.com/professional-boxing-coming-back-norway--70242) suggest Norway may lift its ban in 2014.
7. Market for fitness, self-defense, and competition
